# VBA-Challenge 

This is the VBA challenge that asks to create a script that loops through all the stock for each quarter and output the results.

1. For finding the ticker symbol: it used a if condition to go through all worksheet of tickers and choose the unequal one.

2. Quarterly change is found by subtracting the close price with the open price.

3. The percentage change is found by dividing the quarterly change with the open price for each quarter and for each ticker.

4. The total stock volume is found with using the addition mechanism to sum up the total volume.

5. Greatest % increase, Greatest % decrease and Greatest total volume can be found using the if conditions. 

6. Additionally, the percent change and quarterly change has conditional formatting with the change less than 0 with Red color and greater than 0 with Green and 0 with White. 

7. Mainly the code is about using the FOR Loop and If conditions. It is important to declare the variables and assign the values in VBA.
